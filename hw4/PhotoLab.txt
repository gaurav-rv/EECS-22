In this assignement we were to convert the whole program in such a way that it accepts any photo and is not restricted to any given resolution. In order for this to work we need to make a lot of things a pointer. From there we change all the parameters of the olf code we had. In this process I used most of the code I wrote in the previous assignments, and just modified it to incoperate pointer values. When that did not work I used the solution posted by the TA for the previous assignment.
The overlay and rotate image were fairly simple. However the extra credit border took a while.
