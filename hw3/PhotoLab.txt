In this assignment we had to improve the project created in the previous week. We had to impliment 3 different functions. WIth the basic code provided we broke down the solution of the previous week and pasted it in different parts of the new new files to be submitted. The algorithm was not hard to figure out, it was only time consuming. The Lights function with the given auto type paramenter takes a lng time to load, the program does not freeze at this point. Also, the make file contains all the composition points. The Advanced.c file contains the algorithm for the code we had to prepare for this week. The DIP contains all thenormal operations. I did not have time to work on the extra credit due to all the midterms.
